do you also struggle to pay attention to
0:01
work for more than a few minutes at a
0:03
time well it's not your fault our grains
0:07
are constantly super stimulated
0:10
everything is designed to be too
0:11
delicious too engaging and too shocking
0:14
to wait if you think you have a bad
0:16
spouses jobs and hes have been lost due
0:18
to World of Warcraft at least three
0:21
people have died of dehydration while
0:23
playing computer games other non-fatal
0:25
side effects of the modern world include
0:26
an IQ drop of 10 points just for having
0:29
notification on and also severe
0:31
attentional deficits when spending only
0:34
over 20 minutes a day on your phone I
0:36
don't have all the answers but I do
0:39
struggle with focusing on what I need to
0:42
though instead of downloading and
0:44
reinstalling Instagram every few days
0:47
I've been trying to figure out exactly
0:49
what happens in our brains when we reach
0:51
out for these distractions and therefore
0:55
how to avoid them how can I be more
0:57
peaceful energetic and willing to work
0:59
with any of these three steps sound
1:01
familiar we have some necessary
1:03
unpleasant work to do this leads to a
1:05
drop in our motivation or willpower and
1:08
that leads to procrastination I'll
1:10
explain what I've discovered happens in
1:12
our brains during each of these steps
1:15
and therefore how to change it have
1:16
sustained willpower and do more pleasant
1:19
feeling work let's get straight into it
Willpower: distractable not depleatable
1:21
let's first talk about our drops in
1:24
motivation when we leave a task and
1:26
switch onto something else we think our
1:29
attention has switched from this task
1:31
and also our motivation for this work
1:33
has dropped if our attention was on this
1:36
task or if we simply had more willpower
1:39
to do it we would surely be able to stay
1:41
working this is not true there is a lot
1:45
to suggest that our willpower is a lot
1:47
less depletable than we previously
1:49
thought it does not run out very fast
1:52
even when we think we are out of it we
1:54
actually have a lot more it's just
1:56
hidden see both Arrow willpower and
1:58
working memory or attention
2:00
are both strongly mediated by the same
2:02
part of our brain the dorsal lateral
2:04
prefrontal cortex what this Theory
2:06
suggests is if our attention shifts onto
2:09
something else it will therefore bring
2:11
our motivation along with it being
2:14
perceived by us as a motivation drop for
2:17
the task that we were previously doing
2:18
so it's not just that we are distracted
2:20
but our motivation is distracted too so
2:23
we can't work in order to do a task we
2:26
need to be able to focus on it so we can
2:28
sustain our motivation for that task so
2:30
we need to clear out our brain from
2:32
distractions this means if an intrusive
2:34
thought or desire comes our way and
2:36
takes up space in our working memory we
2:38
need to write it down immediately and
2:40
plan to do it later or even promise to
2:42
ourselves that you know what I'm going
2:43
to think about how horrible of a person
2:45
I am today at 400 p.m. because I don't
2:47
have time to do that right now this can
2:49
help free up working memory space and
2:51
keep our attention focus and motivation
2:53
on the task at hand now I hope I haven't
2:55
lost you because I'm also quite cautious
2:57
of this Theory based on Anatomy alone
2:59
but but very interestingly there are
3:01
lots of important studies that show that
3:03
even thinking that we have endless
3:05
motivation or more motivation than we
3:07
previously thought can help us perform
3:09
better at tasks make less mistakes and
3:12
even somehow increase our IQ by up to 15
3:14
points theism of thinking that we have
3:17
more motivation or that difficult tasks
3:19
make us more motivated helps us perform
3:21
better in general this is very important
3:23
if like me you to subscribe very
3:25
strongly to the ego depletion Theory
3:27
which I'll link somewhere else and at
3:29
the very least planning to procrastinate
3:30
later is very important because it makes
3:32
your phone less accessible to you to
3:34
reach out whenever you want to and
3:36
getting used to removing this option for
3:37
yourself has huge benefits in the long
3:39
term a study found that keeping
3:40
notifications on while we work even if
3:42
we are told explicitly not to look at
3:45
them think about them or check them
3:46
lowers our performance in these tasks
3:49
drastically the average IQ of the people
3:51
in the study dropped by 10 points when
3:53
keeping notifications on and this is
3:54
double the drop seen in studies of
3:56
cannabis users another study of 7,12
3:58
adolescent found found that even
4:00
spending 20 minutes a day on their phone
4:02
lets you severe attentional impairment
4:05
some interesting things in the study
4:06
also found that the more likely you are
4:07
to have your phone by you while you
4:08
sleep or while it's charging also showed
4:11
some intentional impairment probably
4:12
because of the patterns of behavior of
4:14
people like me who are very likely to do
4:16
this so in general it seems the best
4:17
thing that we can do for our willpower
4:19
motivation and focus when it comes to
4:20
electronic devices is keeping them as
4:22
far from us as possible keeping
4:24
notifications off as long as possible
4:26
also spending as little time as we can
4:29
and not reaching for it again and again
4:31
throughout our day be aware that we
4:32
control our Attention our attention
4:34
controls our motivation so we'll be
4:36
motivated for what we focus on before I
4:38
move on to my next point I wanted to
4:39
take a moment and speak to those Among
4:41
Us who like me work and struggle with
4:44
creative projects making these videos to
4:46
save their bit of planning and time and
4:49
amongst the five or so apps that I use
4:52
for scripting is millot who are very
4:54
kindly sponsoring this video I am
4:57
extremely particular when it comes to
4:58
the apps that I use use for work because
5:01
honestly I think that they do affect my
5:02
thinking and output when I'm in the
5:04
planning stages of my scripts in
5:06
particular I will take everything that
5:07
I've worked on so far over to Mid note
5:09
where I can see it all in one space and
5:12
therefore I can move things around and
5:14
check whether the connections exist or
5:17
how strong or weak they are and how to
5:18
link things together as someone who
5:20
currently does the majority of her work
5:21
on a computer it is the best thing that
5:23
I found so far to check my thinking and
5:25
unblock me when I don't know where I'm
5:28
going with a thought or a structure I
5:30
personally prefer to make my own pages
5:32
from scratch I have a video where I
5:33
mention my horizontal thinking and
5:35
that's how I organize things here too
5:36
but if you prefer some pre-made
5:38
structure there is a bunch of themes on
5:39
there already that you can use in order
5:41
to get you jump started and unsto you
5:43
can definitely add photos onto your
5:44
pages to a feature which I extensively
5:46
used while procrastinating from studying
5:48
and spending time thinking how I might
5:50
change my desk setup you can get Mill
5:52
note for completely free with no time
5:54
limit with my link in the description if
5:56
you also work on your computer a lot I
5:57
can me it is the best thing that I have
5:59
done to bridge that gap between writing
6:01
down and typing because having all of
6:04
the space to move things around means
6:05
that you can visualize find a logical
6:07
structure and think a lot easier and
6:10
better I would absolutely give it a go
6:11
especially because you can for
6:12
completely free I'm now going to move on
Ugh fields: why work is hard
6:14
to exploring and potentially changing
6:16
the way that we think about doing
6:18
unpleasant but necessary work now if you
6:21
feel very very guilty for potentially
6:23
procrastinating or not wanting to do
6:25
your studies or your essays or your work
6:29
this can get a lot worse and it's super
6:31
common a very peculiar and extreme case
6:33
of procrastination happens with patients
6:35
with chronic disease an observed effect
6:37
of some patients with a deadly disease
6:39
who have a very important medication
6:41
which is potentially life- saving that
6:43
they need to take every single day is
6:45
that they will sometimes just stop
6:47
taking it and the potential reasoning
6:49
explained for this is that for these
6:51
patients even thinking of the medication
6:53
has such a Negative feeling because of
6:55
course it must feel Dreadful to be
6:56
reminded every day of the physical
6:58
condition that they are in if they take
7:01
two of the medication accidentally then
7:03
maybe they need to go to hospital maybe
7:05
they have a fear of the needles there's
7:06
so many negative associations around it
7:08
that eventually a lot of these patients
7:10
actually stop taking the medication
7:12
altogether even though they know it is
7:15
necessary for their survival the process
7:17
of even thinking of doing the task
7:18
becomes so unpleasant that they stop
7:20
doing it even though they really know
7:22
that they should and they really want to
7:24
the theory that I'm referring to here is
7:26
that of the earth field which describes
7:28
this sub conscious Flinch that we get at
7:31
even thinking of doing a very essential
7:34
but unpleasant task the way that this
7:36
phenomenon is described is that in the
7:37
beginning there's no Flinch and no fear
7:39
or no procrastination there's only very
7:41
real negative consequences for an event
7:44
for example if you don't do good work
7:46
you're going to get fired if you don't
7:47
study well you're going to fail your
7:48
course you're going to be embarrassed if
7:50
you don't pay a very expensive rent
7:51
you're going to be kicked out of your
7:52
house Etc of you will start to feel this
7:55
negative emotional stress when they are
7:56
starting to plan or doing events in this
7:59
direction Direction and eventually they
8:01
might even get to the point where even
8:02
before planning just thinking of
8:04
anything associated with this important
8:06
task or problem means that they have
8:09
this huge negative emotion and they want
8:11
to avoid it immediately this is what's
8:13
potentially happening with the patients
8:14
usually associated with this mess is a
8:16
displacement activity something that
8:19
seems to be comforting or numbing that
8:21
we do instead of doing the test that
8:23
we're supposed to be doing so for
8:24
example having a very important exam and
8:26
instead of revising and studying even
8:28
the week before been watching ATV show
8:31
to numb yourself out and avoid that huge
8:33
negative feeling now there's a solution
8:34
to this and 80% of it is already done by
8:36
listening to what I just said because
8:38
understanding this process means that we
8:40
will realize that this B field or this
8:42
negative strong feeling that requires a
8:45
displac of activity will happen
8:47
essentially before we have started
8:49
planning for a task so the solutions for
8:51
it are one when we are given a task or
8:53
give oursel a task and before we even go
8:55
down the cycle of making it terrible for
8:57
ourselves and having this Flinch realize
8:59
in that this is going to be really bad
9:00
I'm probably going to develop an earth
9:01
field around this so I need to be
9:03
cautious every time I start to think
9:05
about it I need to immediately force
9:07
myself to make a plan because once I
9:09
make a plan these cringe or Flinch will
9:11
go away and I'll be able to complete the
9:13
task also realizing what sort of things
9:15
are being more insecure in because the
9:17
bigger the negativity or the negative
9:19
consequences think about the patients
9:21
for whom risk is actually death the
9:23
bigger the negative consequences the
9:24
bigger the quicker and the stronger this
9:26
Earth field will be developed and the
9:28
more we want to procras for the task so
9:30
realizing where I'm only more insecure
9:32
and more likely to feel that I have
9:33
negative consequences is going to be
9:35
much more helpful for us to be able to
9:37
jump into that planning immediately in
9:38
this way we quiet our lizard emotional
9:40
brain bring things back into our
9:42
prefrontal cortic so we can plan
9:44
organize and structure and we've also
9:46
addressed how to approach necessary but
9:48
unpleasant tasks which leads us with our
Procrastination cure: top-down vs bottom-up decision making
9:50
very last point the last barrier in our
9:52
brains focus on work are the
9:54
displacement Activities The mind-numbing
9:57
Addictive interesting anxiety quietening
10:00
things that we tend to procrastinate on
10:02
when we should be focusing on work
10:04
things that we do when we simply can't
10:06
focus so what I'm going to use here are
10:07
the two ways that our brain can make
10:09
decisions one is a Bottoms Up decision-
10:11
making one is a top down decision-
10:13
making now procrastination I think
10:17
almost all the time is a top down
10:19
decision-making activity which basically
10:21
means it's an automatic rule that we
10:23
always do top down decision- making
10:25
means something is encoded it's
10:26
automatic we from we have a role for it
10:29
so we just implement it it comes top
10:31
down like an order when I'm bored when
10:33
I'm distracted when this is no longer
10:35
interesting when I'm tired when I'm
10:37
hungry when I can't understand what I'm
10:39
doing when I'm scared of the
10:40
consequences of my studying I'll just go
10:42
to Instagram and score the wheels so
10:44
this is a top down decision when we
10:46
procrastinate we're just going for the
10:48
default I'm bored let me grab something
10:50
I wake up in the morning go to my phone
10:52
I finish my work at night get into bed I
10:54
have my 2 hours of scrolling and doing
10:56
whatever I want these are the rules that
10:57
we're just implementing what I'm
10:59
suggesting is that when the opportunity
11:01
arises for us to switch a task or when
11:04
we feel bored or unfocused we don't use
11:07
this top- down processing but we instead
11:09
use bottom up processing now the
11:11
difference between bottom up processing
11:12
is that it's a case-by case basis it
11:14
uses no rules but from the bottom it
11:16
collects everything from our
11:18
surroundings movement and environment
11:20
how do I feel what am I thinking what do
11:22
I need and from that it comes up with a
11:25
single solution for that case so let's
11:27
say that I'm unable focus on my work and
11:30
a top down processing would be let me
11:32
just grab my phone procastinate on my RS
11:33
for a few hours feel too bad and then
11:35
it's oh my God it's too late for me I'll
11:37
just have to go to bed now at 10:00 I'm
11:39
just going to sleep early so I can wake
11:40
up tomorrow and do my work and then I
11:41
end up procrastinating until 2:00 a.m.
11:43
terrible so a bu of odd processing in
11:45
this case would be I'm feeling thirsty
11:47
or I'm feeling distracted or I'm feeling
11:48
anxious or I'm feeling tired or I'm
11:52
uncomfortable in my chair or I've just
11:54
been looking at the screen for too much
11:55
I need a break and then realizing what's
11:57
the actual thing that I need in that
11:58
moment and doing that instead and making
12:00
you energizing I mentioned in my last
12:01
video which I'll link somewhere below
12:03
that I use these dice that I use dice
12:05
like this which have kind of a word
12:07
etched on each corner and I will roll
12:10
the dice and it has complimentary
12:11
activities to things like stretching and
12:13
music and working and calling a friend
12:15
so high energy things with hopefully
12:16
lots of sounds to oppose my quiet
12:19
deadening work which often does become
12:21
boring and I don't want to focus on it
12:22
anymore so I compliment with those
12:24
instead of reaching for my throne and
12:26
just procrastinating on things that I
12:27
wouldn't want to do gaing information
12:29
our head and body to make the right
12:31
decision at the moment is an amazing way
12:33
to change previous patterns of behavior
12:35
that we want to get rid of there was a
12:37
huge info dump of methods and studies in
12:39
this video if you want a summary of
12:41
these that you can refer to or do more
12:43
reading on there's a free notion
12:45
template linked below it'll probably
12:46
have some points or questions and
12:48
guiding things if you don't want to make
12:50
your own notes on this or if you want to
12:51
refer to this information later without
12:53
having to hear my annoying voice
12:55
throughout all over again so if you want
12:57
to get that there'll be a link below
12:58
just download it for free and duplicate
13:00
the template onto your notion but
13:02
otherwise if you made it so far thank
13:03
you so much for spending this time with
13:05
me I hope you have a wonderful rest of
13:06
your day be conscious about others and
13:08
don't believe everything you think than
13:11
bye
